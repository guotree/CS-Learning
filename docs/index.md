<blockquote cite="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">
    There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, 
    innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools. 
    Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. 
    But Type 1 engineers progress toward more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, 
    whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, 
    technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.

Your self-learning journey should encompass 11 essential areas:

1. [Programming](resources/programming.md)
2. [Computer Architecture](resources/architecture.md)
3. [Algorithms and Data Structures](resources/algorithms.md)
4. [Math for CS](resources/math.md)
5. [Operating Systems](resources/operating-systems.md)
6. [Computer Networking](resources/networking.md)
7. [Databases](resources/databases.md)
8. [Languages and Compilers](resources/languages.md)
9. [Distributed Systems](resources/distributed-systems.md)
10. [Artificial Intelligence](resources/ai.md)
11. [Others](resources/others.md)

Before embarking on your self-learning adventure, we recommend starting with an introductory course:

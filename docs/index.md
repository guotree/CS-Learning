        <h1>Computer Science Self Learning Guideline</h1>
        <p>This computer science self-learning guide draws inspiration from <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/" target="_blank">"Teach Yourself Computer Science"</a> and <a href="https://csdiy.wiki/" target="_blank">"csdiy.wiki"</a> presenting the content in a more streamlined and efficient manner.</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">
            There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, 
            innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools. 
            Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. 
            But Type 1 engineers progress toward more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, 
            whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, 
            technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.
